## Customer's Rating Prediction

This project was developed to predict the customer rating based on sales supermarket dataset taken from Kaggle. The three algorithm used to predict the rating are Super Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree.
The dataset then is tested using 4 type of kernels which are RBF, Sigmoid, Linear and Poly and the MSE value is generated and compared to find the most suitable algorithm in predicting this study.
